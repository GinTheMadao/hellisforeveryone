The goal isn't just to defeat enemies but to protect civilian buildings, as their destruction lowers the power grid which serves as your overall health bar. Each run features procedurally generated challenges across different islands, and when defeat is inevitable, one pilot can be sent back in time to start a new timeline with their experience intact.
