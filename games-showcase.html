Players control a squad of time-traveling mechs sent to combat an alien threat called the Vek. The game takes place on small grid-based maps where every enemy move is telegraphed one turn in advance, turning each battle into a precise puzzle. The goal isn't just to defeat enemies but to protect civilian buildings, as their destruction lowers the power grid which serves as your overall health bar. Each run features procedurally generated challenges across different islands, and when defeat is inevitable, one pilot can be sent back in time to start a new timeline with their experience intact. With multiple unlockable mech squads that completely change playstyle, the game offers tremendous strategic depth in a deceptively compact package."

Additional features include a robust level editor for creating custom maps and campaigns, and various multiplayer options including a co-op campaign designed specifically for two players.
